## University of California, Berkeley
**Graduate Student Researcher** | August 2018 - Present
* Developed a novel semi-autonomous multi-unit small unmanned aerial system (sUAS), consisting of >50% structural pulse shape discriminating (PSD) plastic scintillators by weight. Demonstrated
feasibility of ultralight tri-modal (γ-ray, fast neutron, and thermal neutron sensitive) aerial radiation detection system construction.
* Conducted comprehensive evaluation study of structural and optical properties of novel PSD plastic scintillator compositions, in collaboration with Dr. Natalia Zaitseva group of LLNL.
* Developed GEANT4 photon transport models to optimize scintillator geometries employed as
structural sUAS elements.
* Directed a multidisciplinary project team of Masters of Engineering and undergraduate researchers to fulfill grant deliverables and produce multiple theses.

## Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
**Academic Cooperation Program** | May 2019 - Present
* Serving as IEEE Standards AssociationWorking Group Secretary in developing standard N42.61 for
real-time streaming of radiation data from instruments to smartphone devices, under the guidance of Chair Dr. Radoslav Radev.
* Developing standard-specific data transmission schema and accompanying validation toolkit in ASN.1 notation for encoding and decoding of transmitted standard packets.

## University of Michigan Detector for Nuclear Nonproliferation Group
**Consortium for Verification Technologies Fellow** | October 2017 - July 2018
* Conducted research evaluating time resolution, positional resolution, and PSD capabilities of
stilbene-based handheld dual-particle (γ-neutron) imager system, participating in SNM measurement
campaign at the Device Assembly Facility under the guidance of Prof. Sara Pozzi.
* Developed an augmented-reality framework for a time-of-flight neutron-gamma 3D imaging system
using the Microsoft HoloLens and Unity.

## The Dow Chemical Company
**Nuclear Engineering Intern** | May 2017 - August 2017
* Developed a chemometric verification model for polyurethanes plant production quality assessment, culminating in an authored internal publication.
* Developed an in-situ viscosity measurement device for adhesives manufactured by Dow Automotive.
* Calibrated and experimentally verified system operation using raman spectroscopy. Device was installed and operational on plant within 90-day time frame.
